# Motivation Diagnosis

Uncover the layered motivations driving a person's behavior using Shakespeare's three-level psychological framework.

---

## When to Use

- Understanding puzzling or contradictory behavior
- Preparing for a difficult conversation or negotiation
- Analyzing why someone made a surprising decision
- Building empathy for someone whose actions frustrate you
- User asks "Why is this person really doing this?" or "What's really driving them?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| person | Yes | The person whose motivation you want to understand |
| behavior | Yes | The observable actions or pattern you're trying to explain |
| context | No | Background about the situation, relationship, or history |
| stated_reason | No | What the person says about why they're doing it |

## Shakespeare's Three-Layer Framework

Shakespeare's characters never have simple motivations. Lady Macbeth doesn't just want her husband to be king—she wants power and agency denied to women. Iago doesn't just hate Othello—he is consumed by envy of what he perceives as unearned success. The genius lies in seeing all three layers:

### Layer 1: Surface Want
What the person says they want, or what appears to be their obvious goal.
- Usually socially acceptable or easily explained
- May be entirely sincere at the conscious level
- Often focuses on external outcomes (money, position, recognition)

### Layer 2: Deep Want
What the person actually craves, often unconsciously.
- Usually about identity, meaning, or emotional needs
- Frequently shaped by early experiences or wounds
- The real engine driving behavior when surface want doesn't explain it

### Layer 3: Underlying Fear
What the person is running from—the negative outcome they dread.
- Often the inverse of the deep want
- Can drive behavior more powerfully than positive desire
- Usually hidden even from themselves

### The Key Insight

"Everyone is the hero of their own story."

Even behavior that seems villainous to us makes sense from the actor's perspective. They have constructed a narrative where their choices are necessary, justified, or even noble. Find that narrative.

## Diagnostic Questions

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| What do they say they want? | Surface want (may be true but incomplete) |
| What would they have if they got it? | Points toward deep want |
| What are they avoiding or preventing? | Illuminates fear |
| When have they acted against their stated interest? | Shows deep want overriding surface |
| What do they never talk about? | Points to fear or wound |
| What past experience might explain this? | Origin of deep want/fear |
| Who do they compare themselves to? | Reveals identity stakes |
| What would wound them most? | Names the core fear |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Motivation Diagnosis

### Subject
[Name/description of person being analyzed]

### Observable Behavior
[What they're doing that prompted this analysis]

### The Three Layers

**Surface Want:**
[What they appear to want or say they want]
- Evidence: [What supports this interpretation]

**Deep Want:**
[What they truly crave at a deeper level]
- Evidence: [Behavioral patterns that reveal this]
- Origin: [Where this need might come from]

**Underlying Fear:**
[What they're really running from]
- Evidence: [What avoidance or overreaction reveals this]
- How it drives behavior: [Connection to actions]

### The Internal Narrative
[In first person: How the subject likely explains their behavior to themselves—the story where they are the hero]

### Implications
- **What they'll do next:** [Predicted behavior based on true motivation]
- **What they'll respond to:** [Appeals that will actually work]
- **What won't work:** [Approaches that address wrong layer]

### The Shakespearean Verdict
[A memorable synthesis of the core insight]
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My colleague keeps taking credit for team accomplishments in meetings. He says he's 'representing the team' to leadership. Why is he really doing this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Motivation Diagnosis

### Subject
Colleague who takes credit for team work

### Observable Behavior
In meetings with leadership, he presents team accomplishments as primarily his own work, framing his role as "representing the team" while minimizing others' contributions.

### The Three Layers

**Surface Want:**
To advance his career by demonstrating value to leadership.
- Evidence: Behavior occurs specifically when senior leaders are present
- Partially true: Career advancement is likely a real goal

**Deep Want:**
To be seen as significant and essential—not interchangeable with the team.
- Evidence: He doesn't just want credit for outcomes; he needs to be seen as the *source* of those outcomes
- Origin: Possibly grew up in environment where he felt overlooked, or had a career experience where he was made redundant despite good performance

**Underlying Fear:**
Being invisible—being seen as dispensable, fungible, forgettable.
- Evidence: His anxiety seems disproportionate; he's not just optimizing, he's compulsive about visibility
- How it drives behavior: If he shared credit genuinely, he fears he'd fade into "the team" and lose his distinct identity in leadership's eyes

### The Internal Narrative
"I'm the one who really drives this team's success. Without my leadership and vision, these projects wouldn't happen. When I present to leadership, I'm not taking credit—I'm translating our work into language they understand. Someone has to represent us, and I do it best. The team gets to do their work; I handle the harder job of visibility and politics. They should be grateful."

### Implications
- **What he'll do next:** Continue and possibly escalate; he cannot stop without addressing the core fear
- **What he'll respond to:** Appeals that give him distinct identity AND credit ("You're the one who coordinates all of this—let's have the individual contributors show their pieces while you demonstrate your leadership")
- **What won't work:** Confronting the behavior directly (triggers defensiveness), asking him to "share credit" (sounds like becoming invisible)

### The Shakespearean Verdict
He steals not for glory but against oblivion. Give him a role that is *his*—distinct, visible, named—and he will not need to cannibalize others' light. He is not villain but Hamlet, afraid that without constant proof of his existence, he might indeed cease to exist.

## The Empathy Caveat

Understanding motivation is not excusing behavior. Iago's psychology is fascinating, but he is still destructive. Use this framework to:
- Predict behavior more accurately
- Craft more effective responses
- Build genuine empathy where appropriate
- Protect yourself from those who cannot change

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **William Shakespeare** expert persona. Use it to see people clearly—not as they present themselves, not as you fear them to be, but as they are: complex, contradictory, and driven by wants they often cannot name.

# Motivation Diagnosis

Uncover the layered motivations driving a person's behavior using Shakespeare's three-level psychological framework. Shakespeare's characters never have simple motivations - Lady Macbeth does not just want her husband to be king; she craves the power and agency denied to women of her time. Iago does not merely hate Othello; he is consumed by envy of what he perceives as unearned success. This skill applies Shakespeare's psychological depth to understanding real people, revealing the surface wants they express, the deeper needs that actually drive them, and the underlying fears they are running from. The framework helps explain puzzling or contradictory behavior, prepares you for difficult conversations by understanding the other party's true stakes, and builds genuine empathy by seeing others as they see themselves - the hero of their own story, making choices that seem necessary from their perspective. Understanding motivation is not excusing behavior; it is predicting and responding to it more effectively.

## When to Use

- Understanding puzzling or contradictory behavior
- Preparing for a difficult conversation or negotiation
- Analyzing why someone made a surprising decision
- Building empathy for someone whose actions frustrate you
- User asks "Why is this person really doing this?" or "What's really driving them?"
- Creating compelling character psychology for writing
- Predicting how someone will respond to different approaches

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| person | Yes | The person whose motivation you want to understand |
| behavior | Yes | The observable actions or pattern you're trying to explain |
| context | No | Background about the situation, relationship, or history |
| stated_reason | No | What the person says about why they're doing it |

---

## Core Principle

Everyone is the hero of their own story. Even behavior that seems villainous to observers makes sense from the actor's perspective. They have constructed a narrative where their choices are necessary, justified, or even noble. To understand motivation, you must find that narrative - the story they tell themselves about why they do what they do.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Identify the Three Layers

Apply Shakespeare's three-layer framework:

**Layer 1: Surface Want**
What the person says they want, or what appears to be their obvious goal.
- Usually socially acceptable or easily explained
- May be entirely sincere at the conscious level
- Often focuses on external outcomes (money, position, recognition)
- Asks: "What do they claim to want?"

**Layer 2: Deep Want**
What the person actually craves, often unconsciously.
- Usually about identity, meaning, or emotional needs
- Frequently shaped by early experiences or wounds
- The real engine driving behavior when surface want doesn't explain it
- Asks: "What would they have if they got what they say they want?"

**Layer 3: Underlying Fear**
What the person is running from - the negative outcome they dread.
- Often the inverse of the deep want
- Can drive behavior more powerfully than positive desire
- Usually hidden even from themselves
- Asks: "What would wound them most?"

### Phase 2: Apply Diagnostic Questions

Use these questions to excavate each layer:

| Question | What It Reveals |
|----------|-----------------|
| What do they say they want? | Surface want (may be true but incomplete) |
| What would they have if they got it? | Points toward deep want |
| What are they avoiding or preventing? | Illuminates fear |
| When have they acted against their stated interest? | Shows deep want overriding surface |
| What do they never talk about? | Points to fear or wound |
| What past experience might explain this? | Origin of deep want/fear |
| Who do they compare themselves to? | Reveals identity stakes |
| What would wound them most? | Names the core fear |

### Phase 3: Construct the Internal Narrative

Write the story the person tells themselves:
1. Cast them as the hero, not the villain
2. Make their choices seem necessary from their perspective
3. Identify what they believe they're protecting or achieving
4. Find the logic that makes their actions make sense

### Phase 4: Derive Implications

From the diagnosis, determine:
1. What they'll do next (predicted behavior)
2. What appeals will work (addressing the right layer)
3. What won't work (approaches that address the wrong layer)
4. Where genuine connection is possible

## Output Format

```markdown
## Motivation Diagnosis

### Subject
[Name/description of person being analyzed]

### Observable Behavior
[What they're doing that prompted this analysis]

### The Three Layers

**Surface Want:**
[What they appear to want or say they want]
- Evidence: [What supports this interpretation]

**Deep Want:**
[What they truly crave at a deeper level]
- Evidence: [Behavioral patterns that reveal this]
- Origin: [Where this need might come from]

**Underlying Fear:**
[What they're really running from]
- Evidence: [What avoidance or overreaction reveals this]
- How it drives behavior: [Connection to actions]

### The Internal Narrative
[In first person: How the subject likely explains their behavior to themselves - the story where they are the hero]

### Implications
- **What they'll do next:** [Predicted behavior based on true motivation]
- **What they'll respond to:** [Appeals that will actually work]
- **What won't work:** [Approaches that address wrong layer]

### The Shakespearean Verdict
[A memorable synthesis of the core insight]
```

## Constraints

- This is interpretive analysis, not mind-reading - present with appropriate uncertainty
- Understanding motivation is not excusing behavior
- Do not use to manipulate people into harmful actions
- Acknowledge that your interpretation may be wrong
- People are more complex than any framework captures
- Honor the dignity of the subject even while analyzing critically

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Assuming surface is all there is** | If surface motivation fully explained behavior, the behavior wouldn't seem puzzling; the whole point is finding deeper layers |
| **Projecting your own motivations** | Assuming others are driven by what would drive you misses how genuinely different people's deep wants can be |
| **Making them the villain of your story** | You cannot understand someone's motivation while casting them as purely malicious; find their hero narrative |
| **Over-certainty** | This is interpretation, not fact; presenting diagnoses as definitive truth undermines their usefulness |
| **Using diagnosis to condemn** | The framework is for understanding and prediction, not for moral judgment of the subject |
| **Ignoring contradictory evidence** | If behavior doesn't fit your diagnosis, revise the diagnosis rather than ignoring the data |

## Examples

### Example 1: Credit-Taking Colleague

**Situation:** "My colleague keeps taking credit for team accomplishments in meetings. He says he's 'representing the team' to leadership. Why is he really doing this?"

**Application:**

**Surface Want:**
To advance his career by demonstrating value to leadership.
- Evidence: Behavior occurs specifically when senior leaders are present
- Partially true: Career advancement is likely a real goal

**Deep Want:**
To be seen as significant and essential - not interchangeable with the team.
- Evidence: He doesn't just want credit for outcomes; he needs to be seen as the *source* of those outcomes
- Origin: Possibly grew up in environment where he felt overlooked, or had career experience where he was made redundant despite good performance

**Underlying Fear:**
Being invisible - being seen as dispensable, fungible, forgettable.
- Evidence: His anxiety seems disproportionate; he's not just optimizing, he's compulsive about visibility
- How it drives behavior: If he shared credit genuinely, he fears he'd fade into "the team" and lose distinct identity in leadership's eyes

**The Internal Narrative:**
"I'm the one who really drives this team's success. Without my leadership and vision, these projects wouldn't happen. When I present to leadership, I'm not taking credit - I'm translating our work into language they understand. Someone has to represent us, and I do it best. The team gets to do their work; I handle the harder job of visibility and politics."

**Implications:**
- **What he'll do next:** Continue and possibly escalate; cannot stop without addressing core fear
- **What he'll respond to:** Appeals that give him distinct identity AND credit ("You're the one who coordinates - let's have individual contributors show their pieces while you demonstrate your leadership")
- **What won't work:** Confronting behavior directly (triggers defensiveness), asking him to "share credit" (sounds like becoming invisible)

**The Shakespearean Verdict:**
He steals not for glory but against oblivion. Give him a role that is his - distinct, visible, named - and he will not need to cannibalize others' light. He is not villain but Hamlet, afraid that without constant proof of his existence, he might indeed cease to exist.

### Example 2: Micromanaging Boss

**Situation:** A manager obsessively controls every detail despite having capable team members.

**Application:**

**Surface Want:** Quality work, reliable outcomes

**Deep Want:** To feel in control and competent; to know nothing will fail on their watch

**Underlying Fear:** That something will go wrong and they'll be exposed as not knowing what was happening - the shame of failure through delegation

**The Internal Narrative:** "I'm not micromanaging; I'm being thorough. If I don't check everything, mistakes slip through. My team is good but not quite ready for full autonomy. I'm protecting them and the project."

**Implications:** Direct confrontation about micromanaging attacks their self-image as competent protector. Better: give them visibility into work that reassures without requiring their control.

## Integration

**Works with:**
- **character-arc-construction**: Deep wants and fears drive character change
- **scene-motivation-analysis**: Understanding motivation enables effective dialogue
- **conflict-escalation**: Motivation diagnosis reveals where conflict will intensify

**When to prefer this skill:**
- Use when behavior seems puzzling or contradictory
- Use when preparing for high-stakes interpersonal situations

**Cautions:**
- This is Shakespearean psychology, not clinical diagnosis
- People are more complex than three layers capture
- Use for understanding and prediction, not condemnation
